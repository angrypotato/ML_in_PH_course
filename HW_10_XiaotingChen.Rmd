3. Question 12.6.9 on Page 550 in ISLRv2.   
Consider the USArrests data. We will now perform hierarchical clustering on the states.
(a) Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance, cluster the states.
```{r}
data(USArrests)
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests), method = "complete")
plot(hc, main = "Hierarchical Clustering with Complete Linkage",
xlab = "", sub = "", cex = .7)
```

(b) Cut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct clusters. Which states belong to which clusters?
```{r}
label <- cutree(hc, 3)
list(cluster.1 = attributes(label[label == 1]),
     cluster.2 = attributes(label[label == 2]),
     cluster.3 = attributes(label[label == 3]))
```

(c) Hierarchically cluster the states using complete linkage and Euclidean distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation one.
```{r}
data("USArrests")
dta <- scale(USArrests)
hc_2 <- hclust(dist(dta), method = "complete")
plot(hc_2, main = "Hierarchical Clustering with Complete Linkage after Scaling",
xlab = "", sub = "", cex = .7)
```

(d) What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical clustering obtained? In your opinion, should the variables be scaled before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed? Provide a justification for your answer\

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)
USArrests$cluster.1 <- factor(label)
USArrests$cluster.2 <- factor(cutree(hc_2, 3))
USArrests$state <- tolower(rownames(USArrests))
head(USArrests)

plot_usmap(data = USArrests, values = "cluster.1") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = " ") +
  ggtitle("Clusters without scaling")

plot_usmap(data = USArrests, values = "cluster.2") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = " ") +
  ggtitle("Clusters with scaling")

```
After scaling, the clustering shows a geographical trend, where adjacent states tend to be in the same cluster. I think the need to scale depends on the data attributes. In this case, scaling makes sense because the variables have different units, and the average values of each variable vary a lot. Intuitively, without scaling, variable `Assault` may show more importance in computation because it has larger quantity than other variables.
